# Udacity Front End Web Development - Restaurant Review Project
---

## Project Overview:

For the **Restaurant Reviews** projects, I incrementally converted a static webpage to a mobile-ready web application. I took a static design that lacked accessibility and converted the design to be responsive on different sized displays and accessible for screen reader use. I also added a service worker to begin the process of creating a seamless offline experience for users.

### Specification

I was provided the code for a restaurant reviews website.  It had a lot of issues - barely usable on a desktop browser, much less a mobile device. It didn't include any standard accessibility features and it didn't work offline at all. My job was to update this code while maintaining the features.

### How to Run

1. Download the files and unzip them to your desktop.

2.  In this folder, start up a simple HTTP server to serve up the site files on your local computer. Python has some simple tools to do this, and you don't even need to know Python. For most people, it's already installed on your computer. 

In a terminal, check the version of Python you have: `python -V`. If you have Python 2.x, spin up the server with `python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000` (or some other port, if port 8000 is already in use.) For Python 3.x, you can use `python3 -m http.server 8000`. If you don't have Python installed, navigate to Python's [website](https://www.python.org/) to download and install the software.

3. With your server running, visit the site: `http://localhost:8000`.
